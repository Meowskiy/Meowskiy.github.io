		<p><font size="+2">Tf is circuits?</font><p>
		<p>Did you play hsr? Then its artifacts. No? Its like items slots in rpg, body, pants, etc. 4 circs, each has arrow to some direction - it means what slot it goes. 4 of the same picture make a set.</p>
		<p><font size="+2">Does circ gacha worth it?</font></p>
		<p>Its a good shit man, trust me. And you can only get like, 40 as f2p.</p>
		<p><font size="+2">Can I just farm those?</font></p>
		<p>You can, it's farmed at "Twilight of The Gods". 200k power for 1 star circs. 1 million power for 2 stars. </p>
		<p>If you are not a whale, don't expect to get any 2* in the next 10+ days from the server start. In the gacha you can get any of them, any rarity. Even 5*, if you lucky.</p> 
		<p><font size="+2">The details</font></p>
		<p>You level them with the other circs or with circ food. 1* circ has maximum of lvl3. Others are more. Same as hsr, when you get a certain milestone, you get one of the stats boosted.</p>
		<p>Circ has main stat and random extra stats. Two slots main stats are fixed, others are random too, can be DEF, can be ATK, etc.</p>
		<p>For set to be active, you don't need 4 of the same rarity, just the same picture.</p>
		<p><font size="+2">What set is the best?</font></p>
		<p>Idk, ask the #general. I like [Power Of The Gods] one, girl with it goes Sūpā Saiya-jin and its funny.</p>
		<p><font size="+2">My game crushed after I pressed the circ, what to do?</font></p>
		<p>Don't touch it. They said they working on it. It's safe to press at the "Team", then you can just press cultivate, then auto place or remove. You can also level them, just don't touch the circ pic. When you choice what to feed to the circ at the leveling, its fine to touch them, but still don't touch main one pic.</p>
